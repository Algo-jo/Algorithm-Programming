📌 Notes & Limitations
- The program is designed specifically for the Jhouse_Data file, making up to 4000 rows of data.
- Data is loaded fresh from the CSV for each search/sort.
- Sorting uses a bubble sort algorithm — fine for small datasets but not optimized for huge files.
- CSV must match the exact column order in the code.
